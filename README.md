# Learn-Java-Deserialization-Vulnerability
Recently learning about Java deserialization vulnerabilities, I will push the vulnerability payload and vulnerability analysis articles that I have analyzed.

## Deserialization Vulnerability List

I will first analyze the vulnerability payload in the following Java libraries.

- [ ] Groovy
- [ ] JDK7u21
- [ ] Apache Common Collection
- [ ] Spring
- [ ] FastJson
- [ ] Jackson
- [ ] XMLDecoder
- [x] SnakeYaml

After that, I will find some deserialization vulnerabilities in practical applications for analysis.
